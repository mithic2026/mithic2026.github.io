                Are you working with high-dimensional datasets? Curious about how complex, emergent behaviour arises from interactions among many variables?
                Join us for MITHIC 2026, a hands-on workshop exploring how Multivariate Information Theory (MVIT) can help you uncover hidden structures and high-order dependencies in Complex Systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                About the Workshop<br>
                Learn the theoretical and practical tools for analysing interactions beyond the pairwise level, focusing on collective dynamics. We will explore key MVIT metrics like Total Correlation, O-Information, and Partial Information Decomposition, and their applications across disciplines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Topics include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Theory and practice of MVIT metrics</li>
                    <li>Real-world examples in neuroscience, epidemics, and finance</li>
                    <li>Connections to High-Order Network Theory and Topological Data Analysis</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                What to Expect:
                <ul>
                    <li>Expert lecture on MVIT and complex systems</li>
                    <li>Python-based tutorials for MVIT analysis</li>
                    <li>Group work on participant-defined research questions</li>
                    <li>Collaborative roundtables linking MVIT to broader theories</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Who Should Join?<br>
                Open to graduate students, postdocs, and researchers in physics, biology, neuroscience, AI, data science, and related fields. Prior programming experience in Python is helpful but not mandatory.
            </p>

            <p>
                How to Prepare:<br>
                Please come with a research question or dataset you would like to explore using MVIT. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is there high-order coordination in predator-prey ecosystem dynamics?</li>
                    <li>What information do different sensors contribute to predictive maintenance systems?</li>
                    <li>Can I identify synergistic brain regions in resting-state fMRI data?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Registration and funding:<br>
                The workshop is free of charge but registration is mandatory.
                To register, please use the <a href="YOUR_REGISTRATION_LINK">online registration form</a>.
                Due to limited capacity, the maximal number of participants is restricted to 30.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will provide lunch and a coffee break each day. Also, we invite you to a social dinner to complete the event, free of charge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Young scholars with limited or no access to financial resources to participate in the workshop can apply for our student grant.
                Note that this grant will only reimburse travel costs, not accommodation.
            </p>
