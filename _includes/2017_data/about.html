                    The MITHIC workshop brings together researchers from diverse fields to explore how Multivariate Information Theory and high-order interactions shape the behaviour of complex systems. 
                    This event is organised by researchers actively contributing to the intersection of complex systems science, information theory, and higher-order network dynamics.
                    Additionally, the workshop is closely connected to the EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network, <em>‘BeyondTheEdge’</em>. 
                    This EU-funded doctoral network explores how non-pairwise, higher-order interactions drive complex dynamics in networks. 
                    BeyondTheEdge unifies three key themes — foundations, structure, and dynamics — into a cohesive framework for understanding complex systems. 
                    MVIT is a promising field for bridging these areas. One of the organisers, Cyril Rommens, is an early-stage researcher in this project, providing a direct connection between the workshop and the consortium.
