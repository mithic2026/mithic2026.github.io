    <h2>XI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE BIFI 2024</h2>

    <p>
        Come to Zaragoza, one of Spain’s major cities. The capital of the Region of Aragon is located on 
        the banks of the Ebro River, halfway between Madrid and Barcelona. There are many reasons to come 
        to this open, Cosmopolitan and friendly city. Today Zaragoza is a bustling and expanding city with 
        a population of more than 600,000 inhabitants. As its urban development continues to grow, it is 
        now spreading out on both sides of the Ebro river. Thanks to its solid industrial background, 
        buoyant commercial aspect and a first-class hotel infrastructure, Zaragoza has become an ideal 
        center for conferences, trade fairs and congresses. This is also aided by its strategic position 
        at the center of the main provincial capitals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Zaragoza has an excellent and varied hotel infrastructure. Generally, the prices of many of the 
        flagship hotels of upper-middle range are not high at all and remain stable throughout the year. 
        This contributes to a great extent to that both, tourists and businessmen can enjoy the amenities 
        and gastronomy of this multicultural city. Anyway, if we can reach hereinafter some kind of 
        agreement with some of the hotels from the list, the information will be published on this Website.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our selection is based on the proximity to the venue and price-quality ratio.
