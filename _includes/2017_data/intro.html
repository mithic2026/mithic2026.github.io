                    The behaviour of complex systems often arises from intricate interactions between multiple components, not merely pairwise but higher-order interactions. Traditional analysis tools are limited in detecting such complex dependencies.

                <p>
                    <strong>Multivariate Information Theory (MVIT)</strong> offers a robust framework to capture and quantify these interactions, providing tools such as Total Correlation, O-Information, and Partial Information Decomposition.

                <p>
                    This workshop aims to bring together early-career researchers, students, and domain experts to explore MVIT, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. 
                    Thematic focus areas include applications in a range of complex systems — covering neuroscience, epidemics, and systems biology — with special attention to the overlap between MVIT and high-order network theory.

                    By blending instruction with collaborative exploration, the MITHIC workshop seeks to advance understanding of how to use multivariate dependencies to study collective behaviour emerging from high-order interactions and to foster new interdisciplinary research directions.

                    This workshop is closely connected to the EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network, <em>‘BeyondTheEdge’</em>. This EU-funded doctoral network explores how non-pairwise, higher-order interactions drive complex dynamics in networks. BeyondTheEdge unifies three key themes — foundations, structure, and dynamics — into a cohesive framework for understanding complex systems. MVIT is a promising field for bridging these areas. One of the organisers, Cyril Rommens, is an early-stage researcher in this project, providing a direct connection between the workshop and the consortium.
