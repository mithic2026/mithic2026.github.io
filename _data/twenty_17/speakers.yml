  topic: Application of multivariate information theory to complex systems data
  description: In this talk we will explore the critical aspects surrounding the application of multivariate information theory to complex systems data. The talk will cover a range of relevant issues like how to choose a suitable measure and how to estimate it properly, as well as experimental considerations like bias and significance testing. We will conclude by showcasing a few recent examples of multivariate information theory applied to complex systems, and more specifically as a substrate-agnostic bridge between information processing in biological and artificial neural networks.
